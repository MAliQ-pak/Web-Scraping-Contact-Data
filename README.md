# Web-Scraping-Contact-Data
Explore my latest project where I used Python, Jupyter Notebook, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas for web scraping. I gathered names, contact numbers, and addresses from a specific website. This tutorial takes you through the steps, starting with setting up Python, using Beautiful Soup for HTML, and organizing the data with Pandas.

See how I turned raw web data into a structured dataset using these tools. Dive into the code, understand the process, and boost your skills in web scraping and Python. This tutorial, based on my own project, is a great way to learn how to turn messy web info into an organized and useful resource.
